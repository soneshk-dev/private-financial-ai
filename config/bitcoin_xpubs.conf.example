# Bitcoin Wallet Configuration
# Track Bitcoin holdings using extended public keys (xpub/ypub/zpub).
# This allows balance tracking without spending capability.
# Copy this file to: ~/.private-financial-ai/secrets/bitcoin_xpubs.conf

# Format: one wallet per line
# WALLET_NAME=xpub_key

# Examples:
# LEDGER_MAIN=xpub6CUGRUonZSQ4TWtTMmzXdrXDtypWZiD6...
# TREZOR_SAVINGS=zpub6rFR7y4Q2AijBEqTUquhVz398htDFrtymD9xYYfG1...

# How to find your xpub:
# - Ledger Live: Settings > Accounts > (select account) > Advanced > Extended public key
# - Trezor: Trezor Suite > Account details > Show xpub
# - Electrum: Wallet > Information > Master Public Key
# - Most other wallets: Look in settings or "export" options

# Security note:
# xpubs can see all addresses and balances but CANNOT spend funds.
# Still, treat them as sensitive - they reveal your complete transaction history.
